Aims:
-----
A javascript gesture recognition library for iPad and iPhone.  Apple's touch event and gesture objects go some way to providing an API for touch-based interfaces in JS but doesn't really provide enough tracking info.  They also don't provide easy gesture recognition (i.e. no onpinch event).  I'd like to bridge the gap between Apple's touch events and full-on gesture recognition.

Syntax should be as simple as something like:

var watched = jester(element);  // watch an element for gestures
watched.swipe(handler);  // attach a handler to the elements swipe event
watched.unbind("swipe", handler);  // unbind the handler from the swipe event

A basic example can be viewed in the index.html page.  Boot it up on an iphone and swipe the black square.
